Lab Git

Part 1

    Clone that repo to your computer.

$ git clone https://github.com/petrarkaselin/IronTatyana.git
Cloning into 'IronTatyana'...

    Create a file in that folder. Name it about.txt and add a fun fact about yourself. 

$ touch about.txt
$ echo "I've watched more than 2500 movies and shows" > about.txt

    Add the file you just created to the git.

$ git add about.txt

    Commit the changes.

$ git commit -m 'Created about.txt'
[main (root-commit) 133583d] Created about.txt
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 about.txt

    Push the changes to the GitHub and check your repository to make sure everything is there.

$ git push origin main

Part 2

    Fork your classmate's repository.
    Clone the repository, so that you have it locally and can make changes.

$ git clone https://github.com/petrarkaselin/IronTiago.git

    Create a new branch named classmate.

$ git branch classmate

    Create a new file with your name (ex. maya.txt) and finish the following sentence I enrolled Ironhack's Data Analytics bootcamp because.... When you are done, save the changes.

$ touch tatyana.txt

$ echo "I enrolled Ironhack's Data Analytics bootcamp because I want to analyze!" > tatyana.txt

    Add the changes to the git.

$ git add tatyana.txt

    Commit and push the changes. Now, all the changes should be on your GitHub, inside the forked repository.

$ git commit -m 'Created tatyana.txt'
$ git push origin main

    Create a pull request to make changes appear in the original repository.

    Merge the branch your classmate created. Now everyone's repos should have the original file (about.txt) as well as the new one with your classmate's name.
